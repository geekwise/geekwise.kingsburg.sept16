##1: Overview

###Review important concepts from the prior day
* Reviewed the basic resume using `HTML` and `CSS`
* <http://geekwise.github.io/geekwise.kingsburg.sept15.resume.basic/>
* We had an overview of font size using `CSS`
	* pixels `font-size:16px`
	* em `font-size:1em`
	* percentage `font-size:100%`
	* relative keyword `font-size:medium` 

	> All the same size on the browser.
	> 16px,1em,100%,medium (these are the baselines for font sizes on the internet)

	### `CSS` Font Size Options:
	*  Length For Size: (32px,2em)
	*  Relative Size: (large)
	* Percentage: (200%)

### _A few reminders about nameing an `id` and `class`_


####Naming a `CSS` `ID` and `CLASS`:
* `ID` names **_only_** begin with a letter `[A-Za-z]` and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens `-`, underscores `_`, colons `:`, and periods `.`

####The difference between a `CSS` `ID` and `CLASS`:
* The difference between a `class` versus an `id` is that an `ID` `#id_name`selector is for something specific. A `CLASS` `.class_name` is reusable
